# Project2-HigherLower

### I. Description
In this game, the player will be given a randomly generated number between 1 and 13 and will be asked to guess if the hidden number will be higher or lower than the given number. If they guess correctly, they will be rewarded with ingame 'Dollars' which acts as the games score. If they guess incorrectly, the game will end

### II. User Stories
1. As a user I would like to be able to see the first number
2. As a user I would like to be able to input my guess
3. As a user I would like to be rewarded with ingame score if I guess correctly
4. As a user I would like the game to end when I guess incorrectly
5. As a user I would like to be shown what the hidden number was regardless of if I guessed correctly or not

### III. Genre
This project will be a text based guessing game

### Technical Details

##### Programming Language
I will be developing this game using C++ as instructed in the brief. The game will run in a command line interface

##### IDE
For this project I chose to use the IDE 'repl.it'. This is an online IDE that can be used by anyone and supports a wide variety of programming languages, including the language I was using (Javascript). It displays the text editor on the left side of the screen and displays the code as it would look when it is run on the right of the screen. It changes the color of certain parts of your code to help make the code clearer to understand.

To aid in debugging, 'repl.it' will display on the right hand side, any errors that occour when trying to run the code. It will tell me what line of my code the error is on, and what the computer is expecting. This is very helpful to programmers as they can see exactly where the error is and how to fix it
