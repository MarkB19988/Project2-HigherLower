# Project2-HigherLower

### Description
In this game, the player will be given a randomly generated number between 1 and 13 and will be asked to guess if the hidden number will be higher or lower than the given number. If they guess correctly, they will be rewarded with ingame 'Dollars' which acts as the games score. If they guess incorrectly, the game will end

### User Stories
1. As a user I would like to be able to see the first number
2. As a user I would like to be able to input my guess
3. As a user I would like to be rewarded with ingame score if I guess correctly
4. As a user I would like the game to end when I guess incorrectly
5. As a user I would like to be shown what the hidden number was regardless of if I guessed correctly or not
